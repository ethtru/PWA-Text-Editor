# PWA-Text-Editor
Progressive Web App

## Approach

This is a single page text editor designed to be run in the browser. Being a progressive web app, it is able to function while off line. Webpack was used to bundle all JavaScript files, and the webpack plugins generate an HTML file, service work, and manifest file. The Service Worker file (src-sw.js) contains all JavaScript logic related to caching.
